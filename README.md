<h4> This analysis of the Enron Email Dataset focusses on 3 tasks: Anomaly Detection, Social Network Analysis, and Email Body Analysis. </h4>

</div>

-----------------------------------------
### Enron Email Dataset

* The Enron scandal and collapse was one of the largest corporate meltdowns in history. In the year 2000, Enron was one of the largest energy companies in America. Then, after being outed for fraud, it spiraled downward into bankruptcy within a year. 

* The Enron Email Dataset contains 500,000 emails between 150 former Enron employees, mostly senior executives. Itâ€™s the only large public database of real emails, which makes it more valuable. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/). 

------------------------------------------
### Tasks performed

- `Anomaly Detection` : Map the distribution of emails sent and received by hour and try to detect abnormal behavior leading up to the public scandal.
- `Social Network Analysis` : Build a model for communication between employees to find key influencers.
- `Email Analysis` : Analyze the body messages in conjunction with email metadata to classify emails based on their purposes. A word cloud is also generated based on the content of the emails, which gives a visual representation of word frequency and underscores the keywords used.

Find the detailed documentation [here](./Enron_Email_Analysis.pdf).
